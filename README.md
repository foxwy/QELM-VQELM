#### Method

---

**QELM**: Quantum Extreme Learning Machine, a quantum machine learning algorithm based on the HHL algorithm, a new feature mapping is designed, difficult to achieve on near-term quantum devices.

**VQELM**: Variational Quantum Extreme Learning Machine, variational quantum implementation of QELM, suitable for near-term quantum devices.
